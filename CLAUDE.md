### Analysis Summary

# Codebase Map

## High-Level Architecture

The project is structured as a **full-stack application** composed of two primary, independently managed components: a [backend](backend/) server and a [frontend](frontend/) client.

*   The **backend** ([backend/](backend/)) is responsible for handling API requests, managing data persistence, and potentially real-time communication via WebSockets. It exposes a set of RESTful APIs that the frontend consumes.
*   The **frontend** ([frontend/](frontend/)) is a single-page application (SPA) built with React, responsible for the user interface and user interaction. It communicates with the backend via HTTP requests to fetch and send data.

Communication between the frontend and backend primarily occurs over **HTTP/HTTPS** for API calls, with potential **WebSocket** connections for real-time features.

## Backend Architecture

The [backend](backend/) is a Node.js application, likely using Express.js, structured around the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern (though "View" is handled by the frontend).

### Core Components

*   **Server Entry Point** ([server.js](backend/server.js)): This file initializes the Express application, configures middleware, connects to the database, and starts the HTTP server. It also integrates the API routes and potentially WebSocket functionality.
*   **WebSocket Handler** ([websocket.js](backend/websocket.js)): Manages WebSocket connections, enabling real-time communication between the server and connected clients.
*   **Routes** ([routes/routes.js](backend/routes/routes.js)): This module defines the API endpoints and maps them to specific controller functions. It acts as the entry point for incoming HTTP requests, directing them to the appropriate business logic.
    *   It aggregates routes defined for different resources, such as comments, tweets, and users.
*   **Controllers** ([controllers/](backend/controllers/)): These modules contain the business logic for handling incoming requests. They interact with the models to perform operations and send responses back to the client.
    *   **Comments Controller** ([controllers/comentariosController.js](backend/controllers/comentariosController.js)): Handles operations related to user comments (e.g., creating, retrieving, updating, deleting comments).
    *   **Tweets Controller** ([controllers/tweetssController.js](backend/controllers/tweetssController.js)): Manages operations concerning tweets (e.g., posting new tweets, fetching timelines, managing tweet interactions).
    *   **Users Controller** ([controllers/usersController.js](backend/controllers/usersController.js)): Deals with user-specific functionalities, including authentication (login, registration), user profile management, and potentially user-related data retrieval.
*   **Models** ([models/](backend/models/)): These modules define the data structures and provide an interface for interacting with the database. They encapsulate data validation and database operations.
    *   **Comments Model** ([models/comentariosModel.js](backend/models/comentariosModel.js)): Defines the schema and methods for comment data, abstracting database interactions for comments.
    *   **Tweets Model** ([models/tweetsModel.js](backend/models/tweetsModel.js)): Defines the schema and methods for tweet data, handling database operations related to tweets.
    *   **Users Model** ([models/usersModel.js](backend/models/usersModel.js)): Defines the schema and methods for user data, managing user persistence and retrieval from the database.

## Frontend Architecture

The [frontend](frontend/) is a React application built with Vite, following a component-based architecture and utilizing React Hooks and Context API for state management.

### Core Components

*   **Application Entry Point** ([main.jsx](frontend/src/main.jsx)): This file is the primary entry point for the React application. It mounts the main [App.jsx](frontend/src/App.jsx) component into the DOM and sets up global providers, such as the [AuthContext.jsx](frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx).
*   **Main Application Component** ([App.jsx](frontend/src/App.jsx)): The root component of the application, responsible for defining the overall layout and integrating the main routing logic provided by [navigation.jsx](frontend/src/routes/navigation.jsx).
*   **API Services** ([api/](frontend/src/api/)): This directory contains modules responsible for making HTTP requests to the backend API. Each file typically encapsulates API calls for a specific resource.
    *   **Comments API** ([api/comentarios.jsx](frontend/src/api/comentarios.jsx)): Provides functions for interacting with the backend's comments API.
    *   **Token Management** ([api/token.jsx](frontend/src/api/token.jsx)): Handles the storage, retrieval, and management of authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs).
    *   **Tweets API** ([api/tweets.jsx](frontend/src/api/tweets.jsx)): Contains functions for making API calls related to tweets.
    *   **Users API** ([api/users.jsx](frontend/src/api/users.jsx)): Provides functions for user authentication (login, registration) and user profile-related API interactions.
*   **UI Components** ([components/](frontend/src/components/)): This directory houses reusable React components that make up the user interface.
    *   **Chat Component** ([components/chatg/chatg.jsx](frontend/src/components/chatg/chatg.jsx)): Likely implements a chat interface, potentially interacting with WebSockets.
    *   **Login Component** ([components/login/login.jsx](frontend/src/components/login/login.jsx)): Handles user login forms and authentication flow.
    *   **Principal Component** ([components/principal/principal.jsx](frontend/src/components/principal/principal.jsx)): Represents the main dashboard or home screen of the application.
    *   **Registration Component** ([components/registro/registro.jsx](frontend/src/components/registro/registro.jsx)): Manages user registration forms and new account creation.
    *   **Tweet Detail Component** ([components/TweetDetail/TweetDetail.jsx](frontend/src/components/TweetDetail/TweetDetail.jsx)): Displays detailed information about a single tweet.
*   **Context API** ([context/AuthContext.jsx](frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx)): Provides a global context for managing authentication state (e.g., user logged in status, user data, authentication tokens) across the entire application. Components can consume this context without prop drilling.
*   **Custom Hooks** ([hooks/](frontend/src/hooks/)): Contains custom React Hooks that encapsulate reusable stateful logic, often interacting with the API services or context.
    *   **Auth Hook** ([hooks/useAuth.jsx](frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.jsx)): Provides an interface for authentication-related actions and state, often consuming the [AuthContext](frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx).
    *   **Comments Hook** ([hooks/useComentarios.jsx](frontend/src/hooks/useComentarios.jsx)): Encapsulates logic for fetching, posting, and managing comments.
    *   **Tweets Hook** ([hooks/useTweets.jsx](frontend/src/hooks/useTweets.jsx)): Encapsulates logic for fetching, posting, and managing tweets.
    *   **User Hook** ([hooks/useUser.jsx](frontend/src/hooks/useUser.jsx)): Provides an interface for user-related data and actions.
*   **Routing** ([routes/navigation.jsx](frontend/src/routes/navigation.jsx)): Defines the client-side routing configuration, mapping URLs to specific React components and managing navigation within the single-page application.
*   **Modal Component** ([modal/modal.jsx](frontend/src/modal/modal.jsx)): A generic component for displaying modal dialogs.
*   **Utilities** ([constant/utils.jsx](frontend/src/constant/utils.jsx)): Contains general utility functions or constants used across the frontend application.
